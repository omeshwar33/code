Q1.1. Write a program to show Interface Example in java?
interface shape{
	public static final String color = “Red”;
	public void calculateArea();
}

Q2.Write a program a Program with 2 concrete method and 2 abstract method in java ?
abstract class Language {
  abstract void method1(){// abstract method
 System.out.println("This is Java Programming");
}
  abstract void method1();
  void method3() { // regular method
    System.out.println("This is regular method");
  }
   void method4() { // regular method
    System.out.println("This is regular method");
  }
}
abstract class Language {
  // method of abstract class
  public void display() {
    System.out.println("This is Java Programming");
  }
}
class Main extends Language {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // create an object of Main
    Main obj = new Main();
    // access method of abstract class
    // using object of Main class
    obj.method1();
  }
}

Q3.Write a program  to show the use of functional interface in java?
@FunctionalInterface
interface Sample{
    // abstract method
    int calculate(int val);
}
// public class
public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        
        //Implementing the abstract method of the interface
        Sample solution = (int val) -> val+51;
        
        // calling the method
        System.out.println("Ans = "+ solution.calculate(51));
    }
}

Q4.What is an interface in Java?
An interface is a type of abstract class that defines a set of methods without any implementation. 
It only provides the signature of the methods, but not their actual implementation. 
An interface is used to define a contract between a class and its user, 
ensuring that the class adheres to the contract by implementing all the methods defined in the interface.

Q5.What is the use of interface in Java?
Interfaces are used in Java to achieve abstraction. By using the implements keyword, a java class can implement an interface

Q6.What is the lambda expression of Java 8?
A lambda expression is a short block of code which takes in parameters and returns a value. 
Lambda expressions are similar to methods, but they do not need a name and they can be implemented right in the body of a method.

Q7.Can you pass lambda expressions to a method? When?
A lambda expression passed in a method that has an argument of type of functional interface. If we need to pass a lambda expression as an argument, 
the type of parameter receiving the lambda expression argument must be of a functional interface type.

Q8.What is the functional interface in Java 8?
An interface is called a functional interface if it has a single abstract method irrespective of the number of default or static methods

Q9.What is the benefit of lambda expressions in Java 8?
Lambda expressions improve code readability and do not require interpretation. Lambdas allow you to write concise code. 
It encourages the use of functional programming. It simplifies variable scope and encourages code reusability.

Q10.Is it mandatory for a lambda expression to have parameters?
No, These are for single–line lambda expressions having void return type. 
Type 1: No Parameter. Type 2: Single Parameter. The type and return type of the lambdas are automatically inferred
