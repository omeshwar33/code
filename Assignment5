Q1.What is Exception in Java?
An exception is an event that occurs while the program is running and it disrupts the program execution.

Q2.What is Exception Handling?
Exception handling is responding to exceptions when a computer program runs. An exception occurs when an unexpected event happens that requires special processing.
Examples include a user providing abnormal input, a file system error being encountered when trying to read or write a file, or a program attempting to divide by zero.

Q3.What is the difference between Checked and Unchecked Exceptions and Error?
A checked exception is caught at compile time whereas a runtime or unchecked exception is, as it states, at runtime and  error indicates trouble that primarily occurs due to the scarcity of system resources

Q4.What are the difference between throw and throws in Java?
We use the throws keyword to declare what exceptions we can throw from a method. 
The throw keyword, on the other hand, is mainly used to throw an exception explicitly within a block of code or a method. 
We can use the throws keyword in a method signature. It declares what exceptions a method can throw.

Q5.What is multithreading in Java? mention its advantages
Multithreading allows many parts of a program to run simultaneously. 
These parts are referred to as threads, and they are lightweight processes that are available within the process. 
As a result, multithreading increases CPU utilization through multitasking.

Q6.Write a program to create and call a custom exception
class MinBalanceException extends Exception
{
    public MinBalanceException ()
    {
        System.out.println ("Balance is low");
    }
}
public class Main
{
    public static void main (String[]args)
    {
        try
        {
            int acc[] = { 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105 }; // input can be got from runtime too 
            double balance[] = { 900, 2000, 1500, 1560, 1765.50 };
            System.out.println ("Account No\t" + "Balance\t");
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
            {
               System.out.println (acc[i] + "\t\t" + balance[i] + "\t");
               if (balance[i] < 1000)
               {
                   throw new MinBalanceException (); //throwing user defined exception
               }
            }
        }
        catch (MinBalanceException e)
        {
            System.out.println ("Exception caught");
        }
    }
}

Q7.How can you handle exceptions in Java? 
The "catch" block is used to handle the exception. It must be preceded by try block which means we can't use catch block alone.

Q8.What is Thread in Java?
A thread is a thread of execution in a program. The JVM allows an application to have multiple threads of execution running concurrently. 
Every thread has a priority. Threads with higher priority are executed in preference to threads with lower priority.

Q9. What are the two ways of implementing thread in Java?
We can create threads by implementing the runnable interface and overriding the run() method.

Q10.What do you mean by garbage collection?
It is the automated process of deleting code that's no longer needed or used
