Q1. What are the Conditional Operators in Java?
Conditional Operators in Java are used to work on conditions. 
It is a unique operator used in place of 'If-else' statements. 
They make complex code much easy to write and understand
There are three types of the conditional operators in Java:
1) Conditional AND
2) Conditional OR
3) Ternary Operator

Q2.What are types of operators based on the number of operands?
Operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values.
Operators in Java can be classified into 5 types:
1)Arithmetic Operators [+,-,*,/,%]
2)Assignment Operators [=,+=,*=]
3)Relational Operators [==,!=,>,<,>=,<=]
4)Logical Operators [&&,||,!]
5)Unary Operators [+,-,++,--,!]
6)Bitwise Operators [~]

Q3. What is the use of Switch case in Java Programming?
The Switch statement in Java used as a branch statement or decision-making statement that 
provides a way to execute your code on different cases or parts that are based on the value of the expression or condition.

Q4. What are Conditional Statements and use of Conditional statements in Java? 
The common conditional statements in Java are the If-Else statement, the Switch statement, and the Ternary Operator.
Conditional statements in Java are used to make decisions based on certain conditions.

Q5. What is the Syntax of if-else statement?
if (condition) {
  // codes in if block
}
else {
  // codes in else block
}

Q6. How do you compare two Strings in Java?
We can Compare two Strings by using == (Comparison Operator),equals(),equalsIgnoreCase(),compareTo(),compareToIgnoreCase().

Q7. What is a Mutable String in Java and Explain with an example.
A Mutable String can be changed or Modified. 
e.g. StringBuffer str= new StringBuffer("Good");
     str.append(" Morning"); 
Output: Good Morning

Q8. Write a Program to sort a String Alphabetically.
Class Sort{
public static void main(String[]args){
    String str="infosys";
    String res="";
    for(int i=1;i<str.length();i++){
    if(str.charAt(i-1)<str.charAt(i))
    res+=str.charAt(i);
  }
  System.out.println(res);
}
}
Output: finossy

Q9. Write a program to check if letter 'e' is present in the word 'umbrella'.
Class Check{
public static void main(String[]args){
    String str="umbrella";
    for(int i=0;i<str.length();i++){
    if(str.charAt(i)=='e')
    {
      System.out.println("e is present");
    }
}
}
}
Output:  e is present

Q10. Where exactly is the string constant pool located in the memory?
The Java string constant pool is an area in heap memory where Java stores literal string values.
